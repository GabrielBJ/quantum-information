We show improved CPU performance by employing explicit SIMD intrinsics and multi-threading, batched task-based execution across multiple GPUs, and distributed forward and gradient-based quantum circuit executions across multiple nodes.

It is essentially different from the so-called quantum Fourier transform (QFT) defined to be a linear transformation of the amplitudes for the superposition of quantum states. The quantum circuit for the FFT consists of several circuits for elementary arithmetic operations such as a quantum adder, subtractor and shift operations, which are implemented as effectively as possible. Namely, our circuit does not generate any garbage bits. The advantages of our method compared to the QFT are its high versatility, and data storage efficiency in terms, for instance, of the quantum image processing.},

  abstract = {Optimizing of a portfolio of financial assets is a critical industrial problem which can be approximately solved using algorithms suitable for quantum processing units (QPUs). We benchmark the success of this approach using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA); an algorithm targeting gate-model QPUs. Our focus is on the quality of solutions achieved as determined by the Normalized and Complementary Wasserstein Distance, \${\textbackslash}eta\$, which we present in a manner to expose the QAOA as a transporter of probability. Using \${\textbackslash}eta\$ as an application specific benchmark of performance, we measure it on selection of QPUs as a function of QAOA circuit depth \$p\$. At \$n = 2\$ (2 qubits) we find peak solution quality at \$p=5\$ for most systems and for \$n = 3\$ this peak is at \$p=4\$ on a trapped ion QPU. Increasing solution quality with \$p\$ is also observed using variants of the more general Quantum Alternating Operator Ans{\textbackslash}"\{a\}tz at \$p=2\$ for \$n = 2\$ and \$3\$ which has not been previously reported. In identical measurements, \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is observed to be variable at a level exceeding the noise produced from the finite number of shots. This suggests that variability itself should be regarded as a QPU performance benchmark for given applications. While studying the ideal execution of QAOA, we find that \$p=1\$ solution quality degrades when the portfolio budget \$B\$ approaches \$n/2\$ and increases when \$B {\textbackslash}approx 1\$ or \$n-1\$. This trend directly corresponds to the binomial coefficient \$nCB\$ and is connected with the recently reported phenomenon of reachability deficits. Derivative-requiring and derivative-free classical optimizers are benchmarked on the basis of the achieved \${\textbackslash}eta\$ beyond \$p=1\$ to find that derivative-free optimizers are generally more effective for the given computational resources, problem sizes and circuit depths.},

The algorithm allows to classify data into many clusters, and can easily be implemented in few-qubit Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The idea of the algorithm relies on reducing the clustering problem to an optimization, and then solving it via a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) combined with non-orthogonal qubit states. In practice, the method uses maximally-orthogonal states of the target Hilbert space instead of the usual computational basis, allowing for a large number of clusters to be considered even with few qubits. We benchmark the algorithm with numerical simulations using real datasets, showing excellent performance even with one single qubit. Moreover, a tensor network simulation of the algorithm implements, by construction, a quantum-inspired clustering algorithm that can run on current classical hardware.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to have substantial impact on the finance industry, as they will be able to solve certain problems considerably faster than the best known classical algorithms. In this article we describe such potential applications of quantum computing to finance, starting with the state-of-the-art and focusing in particular on recent works by the QC Ware team. We consider quantum speedups for Monte Carlo methods, portfolio optimization, and machine learning. For each application we describe the extent of quantum speedup possible and estimate the quantum resources required to achieve a practical speedup. The near-term relevance of these quantum finance algorithms varies widely across applications - some of them are heuristic algorithms designed to be amenable to near-term prototype quantum computers, while others are proven speedups which require larger-scale quantum computers to implement. We also describe powerful ways to bring these speedups closer to experimental feasibility - in particular describing lower depth algorithms for Monte Carlo methods and quantum machine learning, as well as quantum annealing heuristics for portfolio optimization. This article is targeted at financial professionals and no particular background in quantum computation is assumed.},

However, the huge impact of the experimental design on the results, the small scales within reach today, as well as narratives influenced by the commercialisation of quantum technologies make it difficult to gain robust insights. To facilitate better decision-making we develop an open-source package based on the PennyLane software framework and use it to conduct a large-scale study that systematically tests 12 popular quantum machine learning models on 6 binary classification tasks used to create 160 individual datasets. We find that overall, out-of-the-box classical machine learning models outperform the quantum classifiers. Moreover, removing entanglement from a quantum model often results in as good or better performance, suggesting that "quantumness" may not be the crucial ingredient for the small learning tasks considered here. Our benchmarks also unlock investigations beyond simplistic leaderboard comparisons, and we identify five important questions for quantum model design that follow from our results.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed study of portfolio optimization using different versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For a given list of assets, the portfolio optimization problem is formulated as quadratic binary optimization constrained on the number of assets contained in the portfolio. QAOA has been suggested as a possible candidate for solving this problem (and similar combinatorial optimization problems) more efficiently than classical computers in the case of a sufficiently large number of assets. However, the practical implementation of this algorithm requires a careful consideration of several technical issues, not all of which are discussed in the present literature. The present article intends to fill this gap and thereby provides the reader with a useful guide for applying QAOA to the portfolio optimization problem (and similar problems). In particular, we will discuss several possible choices of the variational form and of different classical algorithms for finding the corresponding optimized parameters. Viewing at the application of QAOA on error-prone NISQ hardware, we also analyse the influence of statistical sampling errors (due to a finite number of shots) and gate and readout errors (due to imperfect quantum hardware). Finally, we define a criterion for distinguishing between `easy' and `hard' instances of the portfolio optimization problem.},

Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7\%\&nbsp;for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7--10 that for 20\,years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with\&nbsp;CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1\&nbsp;million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1\%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000\&nbsp;physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors. An end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes shows the possibility of low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},

  abstract = {In finance, portfolio optimization aims at finding optimal investments maximizing a trade-off between return and risks, given some constraints. Classical formulations of this quadratic optimization problem have exact or heuristic solutions, but the complexity scales up as the market dimension increases. Recently, researchers are evaluating the possibility of facing the complexity scaling issue by employing quantum computing. In this paper, the problem is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which in principle is very efficient. The main outcome of this work consists of the definition of the best hyperparameters to set, in order to perform Portfolio Optimization by VQE on real quantum computers. In particular, a quite general formulation of the constrained quadratic problem is considered, which is translated into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization by the binary encoding of variables and by including constraints in the objective function. This is converted into a set of quantum operators (Ising Hamiltonian), whose minimum eigenvalue is found by VQE and corresponds to the optimal solution. In this work, different hyperparameters of the procedure are analyzed, including different ansatzes and optimization methods by means of experiments on both simulators and real quantum computers. Experiments show that there is a strong dependence of solutions quality on the sufficiently sized quantum computer and correct hyperparameters, and with the best choices, the quantum algorithm run on real quantum devices reaches solutions very close to the exact one, with a strong convergence rate towards the classical solution, even without error-mitigation techniques. Moreover, results obtained on different real quantum devices, for a small-sized example, show the relation between the quality of the solution and the dimension of the quantum processor. Evidences allow concluding which are the best ways to solve real Portfolio Optimization problems by VQE on quantum devices, and confirm the possibility to solve them with higher efficiency, with respect to existing methods, as soon as the size of quantum hardware will be sufficiently high.},

By backtesting classical and quantum computing algorithms, we can get a sense of how these algorithms might perform in the real world. This work establishes a methodology for backtesting classical and quantum algorithms in equivalent conditions, and uses it to explore four quantum and three classical computing algorithms for portfolio optimization and compares the results. Running 10 000 experiments on equivalent conditions we find that quantum can match or slightly outperform classical results, showing a better escalability trend. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic backtesting comparison of classical and quantum portfolio optimization algorithms. In this work, we also analyze in more detail the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, applied to solve the portfolio optimization problem, running on simulators and real quantum computers from IBM. The benefits and drawbacks of backtesting are discussed, as well as some of the challenges involved in using real quantum computers of more than 100 qubits. Results show quantum algorithms can be competitive with classical ones, with the advantage of being able to handle a large number of assets in a reasonable time on a future larger quantum computer.},

A key requirement to realize this advantage is efficient state preparation. If state preparation is too expensive, it can diminish the quantum advantage. Preparing arbitrary quantum states has exponential complexity with respect to the number of qubits, and thus, is not applicable. Currently known efficient techniques require problems based on log-concave probability distributions, involve learning an unknown distribution from empirical data, or fully rely on quantum arithmetic. In this paper, we introduce an approach to simplify state preparation, together with a circuit optimization technique, both of which can help reduce the circuit complexity for QAE state preparation significantly. We demonstrate the introduced techniques for a numerical integration example on real quantum hardware, as well as for option pricing under the Heston model, i.e., based on a stochastic volatility process, using simulation.},

In this work, we present Grad DFT: a fully differentiable JAX-based DFT library, enabling quick prototyping and experimentation with machine learning-enhanced exchange-correlation energy functionals. Grad DFT employs a pioneering parametrization of exchange-correlation functionals constructed using a weighted sum of energy densities, where the weights are determined using neural networks. Moreover, Grad DFT encompasses a comprehensive suite of auxiliary functions, notably featuring a just-in-time compilable and fully differentiable self-consistent iterative procedure. To support training and benchmarking efforts, we additionally compile a curated dataset of experimental dissociation energies of dimers, half of which contain transition metal atoms characterized by strong electronic correlations. The software library is tested against experimental results to study the generalization capabilities of a neural functional across potential energy surfaces and atomic species, as well as the effect of training data noise on the resulting model accuracy.},

This in turn requires suppressing errors to levels inversely proportional to the size of the computation. As a step towards this ambitious goal, we present experiments on a trapped-ion QCCD processor where, through the use of fault-tolerant encoding and error correction, we are able to suppress logical error rates to levels below the physical error rates. In particular, we show Bell states encoded in the [[7,1,3]] code with error rates 9.8 to 500 times lower than at the physical level, and Bell states encoded in a [[12,2,4]] code with error rates 4.7 to 800 times lower than at the physical level, depending on the judicious use of post-selection. Moreover, we demonstrate repeated error correction with the [[12,2,4]] code, with logical error rates below physical circuit baselines corresponding to repeated CNOTs, and show evidence that the error rate per error correction cycle, which consists of over 100 physical CNOTs, approaches the error rate of two physical CNOTs. These results signify an important transition from noisy intermediate scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing, and demonstrate advanced capabilities required for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

  abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computers like the D-Wave 2000Q can approximately solve the QUBO problem, which is an NP-hard problem, and have been shown to outperform classical computers on several instances. Solving the QUBO problem literally means solving virtually any NP-hard problem like the traveling salesman problem, airline scheduling problem, protein folding problem, genotype imputation problem, thereby enabling significant scientific progress, and potentially saving millions/billions of dollars in logistics, airlines, healthcare and many other industries. However, before QUBO problems are solved on quantum computers, they must be embedded (or compiled) onto the hardware of quantum computers, which in itself is a very hard problem. In this work, we propose an efficient embedding algorithm, that lets us embed QUBO problems fast, uses less qubits and gets the objective function value close to the global minimum value. We then compare the performance of our embedding algorithm to that of D-Wave's embedding algorithm, which is the current state of the art, and show that our embedding algorithm convincingly outperforms D-Wave's embedding algorithm. Our embedding approach works with perfect Chimera graphs, i.e., Chimera graphs with no missing qubits.},

This disagreement does not appear to be due to known systematic errors and may therefore be hinting at new fundamental physics. Although all of the current techniques have their own merits, further improvement in constraining the Hubble constant requires the development of as many independent methods as possible. In this work, we use SNe~II as standardisable candles to obtain an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Using seven SNe~II with host-galaxy distances measured from Cepheid variables or the tip of the red giant branch, we derive H\$\_0= 75.8{\textasciicircum}\{+5.2\}\_\{-4.9\}\$\,km\,s-1\,Mpc-1 (statistical errors only). Our value favours that obtained from the conventional distance ladder (Cepheids~+~SNe~Ia) and exhibits a difference of 8.4\,km\,s-1\,Mpc-1 from the Planck + {$\Lambda$}CDM value. Adding an estimate of the systematic errors (2.8\,km\,s-1\,Mpc-1) changes the {$\sim$}1.7{$\sigma$} discrepancy with Planck +{$\Lambda$}CDM to {$\sim$}1.4{$\sigma$}. Including the systematic errors and performing a bootstrap simulation, we confirm that the local H0 value exceeds the value from the early Universe with a confidence level of 95\,per\,cent. As in this work, we only exchange SNe~II for SNe~Ia to measure extragalactic distances, we demonstrate that there is no evidence that SNe~Ia are the source of the H0 tension.},

However, we show that this reduced accuracy is often well within reasonable limits and hence very acceptable from a practical point of view. The concrete examples concern fitting and estimation. In the fitting context, we fit sophisticated Greek profiles and summarize implied volatility surfaces.

We experimentally explore a novel approach to this problem by using a D-Wave quantum annealer, benchmarking its performance for attaining a financial equilibrium. To be specific, the equilibrium condition of a nonlinear financial model is embedded into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which is then transformed into a spin-1/2 Hamiltonian with at most, two-qubit interactions. The problem is thus equivalent to finding the ground state of an interacting spin Hamiltonian, which can be approximated with a quantum annealer. The size of the simulation is mainly constrained by the necessity of a large number of physical qubits representing a logical qubit with the correct connectivity. Our experiment paves the way for the codification of this quantitative macroeconomics problem in quantum annealers.},

  abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid algorithm to find the minimum eigenvalue/vector of the given Hamiltonian by optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) using a classical computer. Sequential optimization methods, which are often used in quantum circuit tensor networks, are popular for optimizing the parameterized gates of PQCs. In this paper, we focus on the case where the components to be optimized are single-qubit gates, in which the analytic optimization of a single-qubit gate is sequentially performed. The analytical solution is given by diagonalization of a matrix whose elements are computed from the expectation values of observables specified by a set of predetermined parameters, which we refer to as the parameter configurations. In this paper, we first show that the optimization accuracy significantly depends on the choice of parameter configurations owing to the statistical errors in the expectation values. We then identify a metric that quantifies the optimization accuracy of a parameter configuration for all possible statistical errors, named configuration overhead/cost or C-cost. We theoretically provide the lower bound of C-cost and show that, for the minimum size of parameter configurations, the lower bound is achieved if and only if the parameter configuration satisfies the so-called equiangular line condition. Finally, we provide numerical experiments demonstrating that the optimal parameter configuration exhibits the best result in several VQE problems. We hope that this general statistical methodology will enhance the efficacy of sequential optimization of PQCs for solving practical problems with near-term quantum devices.},

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

By its association with the Ising problem in physics, the QUBO model has emerged as an underpinning of the quantum computing area known as quantum annealing and has become a subject of study in neuromorphic computing. Through these connections, QUBO models lie at the heart of experimentation carried out with quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems and neuromorphic computers developed by IBM. Computational experience is being amassed by both the classical and the quantum computing communities that highlights not only the potential of the QUBO model but also its effectiveness as an alternative to traditional modeling and solution methodologies. This tutorial discloses the basic features of the QUBO model that give it the power and flexibility to encompass the range of applications that have thrust it onto center stage of the optimization field. We show how many different types of constraining relationships arising in practice can be embodied within the "unconstrained" QUBO formulation in a very natural manner using penalty functions, yielding exact model representations in contrast to the approximate representations produced by customary uses of penalty functions. Each step of generating such models is illustrated in detail by simple numerical examples, to highlight the convenience of using QUBO models in numerous settings. We also describe recent innovations for solving QUBO models that offer a fertile avenue for integrating classical and quantum computing and for applying these models in machine learning.},

Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code.

Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

In this setting, given access to zeroth-order oracles (that is, the loss function is accessed as a black box that returns the function value for any queried input), a player attempts to minimize a sequence of adversarially generated convex loss functions. This procedure can be described as a T round iterative game between the player and the adversary. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms for the problem and show for the first time that potential quantum advantages are possible for problems of OCO. Specifically, our contributions are as follows. (i) When the player is allowed to query zeroth-order oracles O(1) times in each round as feedback, we give a quantum algorithm that achieves regret without additional dependence of the dimension n, which outperforms the already known optimal classical algorithm only achieving regret. Note that the regret of our quantum algorithm has achieved the lower bound of classical first-order methods.

In fact, finance is estimated to be the first industry sector to benefit from quantum computing, not only in the medium and long terms, but even in the short term. This survey paper presents a comprehensive summary of the state of the art of quantum computing for financial applications, with particular emphasis on stochastic modeling, optimization, and machine learning, describing how these solutions, adapted to work on a quantum computer, can potentially help to solve financial problems, such as derivative pricing, risk modeling, portfolio optimization, natural language processing, and fraud detection, more efficiently and accurately. We also discuss the feasibility of these algorithms on near-term quantum computers with various hardware implementations and demonstrate how they relate to a wide range of use cases in finance. We hope this article will not only serve as a reference for academic researchers and industry practitioners but also inspire new ideas for future research.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is a game-changing technology for global academia, research centers and industries including computational science, mathematics, finance, pharmaceutical, materials science, chemistry and cryptography. Although it has seen a major boost in the last decade, we are still a long way from reaching the maturity of a full-fledged quantum computer. That said, we will be in the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for a long time, working on dozens or even thousands of qubits quantum computing systems. An outstanding challenge, then, is to come up with an application that can reliably carry out a nontrivial task of interest on the near-term quantum devices with non-negligible quantum noise. To address this challenge, several near-term quantum computing techniques, including variational quantum algorithms, error mitigation, quantum circuit compilation and benchmarking protocols, have been proposed to characterize and mitigate errors, and to implement algorithms with a certain resistance to noise, so as to enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum devices and explore the boundaries of their ability to realize useful applications. Besides, the development of near-term quantum devices is inseparable from the efficient classical simulation, which plays a vital role in quantum algorithm design and verification, error-tolerant verification and other applications. This review will provide a thorough introduction of these near-term quantum computing techniques, report on their progress, and finally discuss the future prospect of these techniques, which we hope will motivate researchers to undertake additional studies in this field.},

  abstract = {The intractability of deterministic solutions in solving \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{NP\}\$\$-Hard Combinatorial Optimisation Problems (COP) is well reported in the literature. One mechanism for overcoming this difficulty has been the use of efficient COP non-deterministic approaches. However, with the advent of quantum technology, these modern devices' potential to overcome this tractability limitation requires exploration. This paper juxtaposes classical and quantum optimisation algorithms' performance to solve two common COP, namely the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem. Two accepted classical optimisation methods, Branch and Bound and Simulated Annealing, are compared to two quantum optimisation methods, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are, respectively, executed on both classical devices and IBM's suite of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We have encoded the COP problems for the respective technologies and algorithms and provided the computational encodings for the NISQ devices. Our experimental results show that current classical devices significantly outperform the presently available NISQ devices, which both agree with and extend on those findings reported in the literature. Further, we introduce additional performance metrics to better compare the two approaches with respect to computational time, feasibility and solution quality. Our results show that the VQE performs better than QAOA with respect to these metrics, and we infer that this is due to the increased number of operations required. Additionally, we investigate the impact of a new set of basis gates on the quantum optimisation techniques and show they yield no notable improvement on obtained results. Finally, we highlight the present shortcomings of state-of-the-art NISQ IBM quantum devices and argue for continued future work on improving evolving devices.},

Here we achieve this goal by realizing quantum-critical spin-glass dynamics on thousands of qubits with a superconducting quantum annealer. We first demonstrate quantitative agreement between quantum annealing and time~evolution of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation in small spin glasses. We then measure dynamics in three-dimensional spin glasses on thousands of qubits, for which classical simulation of many-body quantum dynamics is intractable. We extract critical exponents that clearly distinguish quantum annealing from the slower stochastic dynamics of analogous Monte Carlo algorithms, providing both theoretical and experimental support for large-scale quantum simulation and a scaling advantage in energy optimization.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. Establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. One such problem is the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of a magnetic spin system quenched through a quantum phase transition. State-of-the-art classical simulations demand resources that grow exponentially with system size. Here we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench in two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for classical approaches. We assess approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks and conclude that no known approach can achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable timeframe. Thus quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that classical computers cannot.},

Markowitz's portfolio optimisation methods were widely believed to diversify the risks until 2010, when it caught the financial market practitioners by surprise. But the scale of misjudgement raised doubts and opened the drawbacks of existing methods in portfolio construction and risk management. In this study, we propose a new technique for portfolio construction and unsystematic risk optimisation, using a well known meta heuristic from evolutionary computation, known as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). We build a portfolio construction model using machine learning methods, to minimise risk contributors from our universe of securities, and then target to increase the asset diversification by maximising the maximum-diversification ratio. We apply boosting techniques to construct portfolio using ensemble of two well known techniques, known as maximum diversification ratio and risk budgeting of portfolio. We have benchmarked our findings by examining the returns of major global indices, and then illustrate our results by comparing with an alternate well known portfolio construction technique, the risk parity portfolio. For comparison, we have considered the length of investment horizon, returns and risks, as factors to present our findings by using the proposed portfolio optimisation and diversification method. Our technique offers practical insights and scope for further investigation into alternate methods of portfolio diversification and risk management using machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {We introduce a versatile method for preparing a quantum state whose amplitudes are given by some known function. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require handcrafted reversible arithmetic circuits, or quantum memory loads, to encode the function values. Instead, we use a template quantum eigenvalue transformation circuit to convert a low cost block encoding of the sine function into the desired function. Our method uses only 4 ancilla qubits (3 if the approximating polynomial has definite parity), providing order-of-magnitude qubit count reductions compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using a similar number of Toffoli gates if the function can be well represented by a polynomial or Fourier approximation. Like black-box methods, the complexity of our approach depends on the 'L2-norm filling-fraction' of the function. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method for preparing states commonly used in quantum algorithms, such as Gaussian and Kaiser window states.},

  abstract = {Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when compared to what is available today. To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as `the quantum variational eigensolver' was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.},

In this work, we describe a quantum algorithm which can accelerate Monte Carlo methods in a very general setting. The algorithm estimates the expected output value of an arbitrary randomized or quantum subroutine with bounded variance, achieving a near-quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. Combining the algorithm with the use of quantum walks gives a quantum speedup of the fastest known classical algorithms with rigorous performance bounds for computing partition functions, which use multiple-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The quantum algorithm can also be used to estimate the total variation distance between probability distributions efficiently.},

  abstract = {Quantum annealing is a generic solver for optimization problems that uses fictitious quantum fluctuation. The most groundbreaking progress in the research field of quantum annealing is its hardware implementation, i.e., the so-called quantum annealer, using artificial spins. However, the connectivity between the artificial spins is sparse and limited on a special network known as the chimera graph. Several embedding techniques have been proposed, but the number of logical spins, which represents the optimization problems to be solved, is drastically reduced. In particular, an optimization problem including fully or even partly connected spins suffers from low embeddable size on the chimera graph. In the present study, we propose an alternative approach to solve a large-scale optimization problem on the chimera graph via a well-known method in statistical mechanics called the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation or its variants. The proposed method can be used to deal with a fully connected Ising model without embedding on the chimera graph and leads to nontrivial results of the optimization problem. We tested the proposed method with a number of partition problems involving solving linear equations and the traffic flow optimization problem in Sendai and Kyoto cities in Japan.},

  abstract = {A derivative is a financial security whose value is a function of underlying traded assets and market outcomes. Pricing a financial derivative involves setting up a market model, finding a martingale (``fair game") probability measure for the model from the given asset prices, and using that probability measure to price the derivative. When the number of underlying assets and/or the number of market outcomes in the model is large, pricing can be computationally demanding. We show that a variety of quantum techniques can be applied to the pricing problem in finance, with a particular focus on incomplete markets. We discuss three different methods that are distinct from previous works: they do not use the quantum algorithms for Monte Carlo estimation and they extract the martingale measure from market variables akin to bootstrapping, a common practice among financial institutions. The first two methods are based on a formulation of the pricing problem into a linear program and are using respectively the quantum zero-sum game algorithm and the quantum simplex algorithm as subroutines. For the last algorithm, we formalize a new market assumption milder than market completeness for which quantum linear systems solvers can be applied with the associated potential for large speedups. As a prototype use case, we conduct numerical experiments in the framework of the Black-Scholes-Merton model.},

  abstract = {This accessible new edition explores the major topics in Monte Carlo simulation that have arisen over the past 30 years and presents a sound foundation for problem solving  Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method, Third Edition reflects the latest developments in the field and presents a fully updated and comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art theory, methods and applications that have emerged in Monte Carlo simulation since the publication of the classic First Edition over more than a quarter of a century ago. While maintaining its accessible and intuitive approach, this revised edition features a wealth of up-to-date information that facilitates a deeper understanding of problem solving across a wide array of subject areas, such as engineering, statistics, computer science, mathematics, and the physical and life sciences. The book begins with a modernized introduction that addresses the basic concepts of probability, Markov processes, and convex optimization. Subsequent chapters discuss the dramatic changes that have occurred in the field of the Monte Carlo method, with coverage of many modern topics including: Markov Chain Monte Carlo, variance reduction techniques such as importance (re-)sampling, and the transform likelihood ratio method, the score function method for sensitivity analysis, the stochastic approximation method and the stochastic counter-part method for Monte Carlo optimization, the cross-entropy method for rare events estimation and combinatorial optimization, and application of Monte Carlo techniques for counting problems. An extensive range of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter, as well as a generous sampling of applied examples. The Third Edition features a new chapter on the highly versatile splitting method, with applications to rare-event estimation, counting, sampling, and optimization. A second new chapter introduces the stochastic enumeration method, which is a new fast sequential Monte Carlo method for tree search. In addition, the Third Edition features new material on: {$\bullet$} Random number generation, including multiple-recursive generators and the Mersenne Twister {$\bullet$} Simulation of Gaussian processes, Brownian motion, and diffusion processes {$\bullet$} Multilevel Monte Carlo method {$\bullet$} New enhancements of the cross-entropy (CE) method, including the ``improved'' CE method, which uses sampling from the zero-variance distribution to find the optimal importance sampling parameters {$\bullet$} Over 100 algorithms in modern pseudo code with flow control {$\bullet$} Over 25 new exercises Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method, Third Edition is an excellent text for upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate courses in stochastic simulation and Monte Carlo techniques.

  abstract = {A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit optimization. Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count optimization, i.e., minimizing the number of T gates that are needed to implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which significantly reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks (even when compared without making use of gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for multiplication in finite fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating it can save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.},

  abstract = {Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small-to-medium size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We provide both a fully explicit description of Hastings's method and propose a substantially simplified weight reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph and lifted product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor, but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes in a photonic quantum computing architecture based on GKP qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight reduction method substantially improves code performance.},

To this end, by taking seven portfolios of Shanghai stock as a case study, the mean and standard deviation of daily return values are calculated based on five years of real data. The optimal values corresponding to each random case were then stored as a comprehensive database of system responses. Then, by sorting the resulting optimal values from best to worst, the exceedance probabilities of return and risk rankings were calculated for each portfolio and presented in the form of probabilistic pie charts. The results showed that the portfolio with the highest deterministic rate of return has the highest probability of getting the best return ranking as well. However, since the probability of risk in all cases was calculated, the probability of each portfolio to place in the lower rankings (i.e., ranking 2--7) could also be discussed. Additionally, to check the convergence of the model, the probability values calculated by the Monte Carlo method against the sample size were plotted to ensure the accuracy of the final answer. Eventually, by generating Gaussian random noise and importing it into the model input, probability changes were calculated to assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {In quantitative trading, stock prediction plays an important role in developing an effective trading strategy to achieve a substantial return. Prediction outcomes also are the prerequisites for active portfolio construction and optimization. However, the stock prediction is a challenging task because of the diversified factors involved such as uncertainty and instability. Most of the previous research focuses on analyzing financial historical data based on statistical techniques, which is known as a type of time series analysis with limited achievements. Recently, deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN), has been designed to work with sequence prediction. In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is a special kind of RNN, is proposed to predict stock movement based on historical data. In order to construct an efficient portfolio, multiple portfolio optimization techniques, including equal-weighted modeling (EQ), simulation modeling Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and optimization modeling mean variant optimization (MVO), are used to improve the portfolio performance. The results showed that our proposed LSTM prediction model works efficiently by obtaining high accuracy from stock prediction. The constructed portfolios based on the LSTM prediction model outperformed other constructed portfolios-based prediction models such as linear regression and support vector machine. In addition, optimization techniques showed a significant improvement in the return and Sharpe ratio of the constructed portfolios. Furthermore, our constructed portfolios beat the benchmark Standard and Poor 500 (S\&P 500) index in both active returns and Sharpe ratios.},

One of those algorithms is based on the maximum likelihood estimate with parallelized quantum circuits. In this paper, we extend this method so that it incorporates the realistic noise effect, and then give an experimental demonstration on a superconducting IBM Quantum device. The maximum likelihood estimator is constructed based on the model assuming the depolarization noise. We then formulate the problem as a two-parameters estimation problem with respect to the target amplitude parameter and the noise parameter. In particular we show that there exist anomalous target values, where the Fisher information matrix becomes degenerate and consequently the estimation error cannot be improved even by increasing the number of amplitude amplifications. The experimental demonstration shows that the proposed maximum likelihood estimator achieves quantum speedup in the number of queries, though the estimation error saturates due to the noise. This saturated value of estimation error is consistent to the theory, which implies the validity of the depolarization noise model and thereby enables us to predict the basic requirement on the hardware components (particularly the gate error) in quantum computers to realize the quantum speedup in the amplitude estimation task.},

Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits. The VQE may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation of errors, and best practices are suggested. We identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.},

We show that a quantum computer can very efficiently compute an approximate subgradient of a convex Lipschitz function. Combining this with a simplification of recent classical work of Lee, Sidford, and Vempala gives our efficient separation oracle. This in turn implies, via a known algorithm, that \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(n)\$ quantum queries to a membership oracle suffice to implement an optimization oracle (the best known classical upper bound on the number of membership queries is quadratic). We also prove several lower bounds: \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\})\$ quantum separation (or membership) queries are needed for optimization if the algorithm knows an interior point of the convex set, and \${\textbackslash}Omega(n)\$ quantum separation queries are needed if it does not.},

As one of the most promising methods, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has been extensively studied. In this paper, VQE is applied to solve portfolio optimization problems in finance by designing two hardware-efficient Dicke state ansatze that reach a maximum of 2n two-qubit gate depth and n{\textasciicircum}2/4 parameters, with n being the number of qubits used. Both ansatze are partitioning-friendly, allowing for the proposal of a highly scalable quantum/classical hybrid distributed computing (HDC) scheme. Combining simultaneous sampling, problem-specific measurement error mitigation, and fragment reuse techniques, we successfully implement the HDC experiments on the superconducting quantum computer Wu Kong with up to 55 qubits. The simulation and experimental results illustrate that the restricted expressibility of the ansatze, induced by the small number of parameters and limited entanglement, is advantageous for solving classical optimization problems with the cost function of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) for the NISQ era and beyond. Furthermore, the HDC scheme shows great potential for achieving quantum advantage in the NISQ era. We hope that the heuristic idea presented in this paper can motivate fruitful investigations in current and future quantum computing paradigms.},

  abstract = {We present a quantum algorithm that analyzes risk more efficiently than Monte Carlo simulations traditionally used on classical computers. We employ quantum amplitude estimation to price securities and evaluate risk measures such as Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk on a gate-based quantum computer. Additionally, we show how to implement this algorithm and how to trade-off the convergence rate of the algorithm and the circuit depth. The shortest possible circuit depth---growing polynomially in the number of qubits representing the uncertainty---leads to a convergence rate of O(M-2/3), where M is the number of samples. This is already faster than classical Monte Carlo simulations which converge at a rate of O(M-1/2). If we allow the circuit depth to grow faster, but still polynomially, the convergence rate quickly approaches the optimum of O(M-1). Thus, for slowly increasing circuit depths our algorithm provides a near quadratic speed-up compared to Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate our algorithm using two toy models. In the first model we use real hardware, such as the IBM Q Experience, to price a Treasury-bill (T-bill) faced by a possible interest rate increase. In the second model, we simulate our algorithm to illustrate how a quantum computer can determine financial risk for a two-asset portfolio made up of government debt with different maturity dates. Both models confirm the improved convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods. Using simulations, we also evaluate the impact of cross-talk and energy relaxation errors.},

In recent years, advances in quantum technologies have enabled the development of small- and intermediate-scale quantum processors that implement the quantum annealing algorithm for programmable use. Specifically, quantum annealing processors produced by D-Wave Systems have been studied and tested extensively in both research and industrial settings across different disciplines. In this paper we provide a literature review of the theoretical motivations for quantum annealing as a heuristic quantum optimization algorithm, the software and hardware that is required to use such quantum processors, and the state-of-the-art applications and proofs-of-concepts that have been demonstrated using them. The goal of our review is to provide a centralized and condensed source regarding applications of quantum annealing technology. We identify the advantages, limitations, and potential of quantum annealing for both researchers and practitioners from various fields.},

  abstract = {Despite its undeniable success, classical machine learning remains a resource-intensive process. Practical computational efforts for training state-of-the-art models can now only be handled by high speed computer hardware. As this trend is expected to continue, it should come as no surprise that an increasing number of machine learning researchers are investigating the possible advantages of quantum computing. The scientific literature on Quantum Machine Learning is now enormous, and a review of its current state that can be comprehended without a physics background is necessary. The objective of this study is to present a review of Quantum Machine Learning from the perspective of conventional techniques. Departing from giving a research path from fundamental quantum theory through Quantum Machine Learning algorithms from a computer scientist's perspective, we discuss a set of basic algorithms for Quantum Machine Learning, which are the fundamental components for Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. We implement the Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) on a quantum computer to recognize handwritten digits, and compare its performance to that of its classical counterpart, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, we implement the QSVM on the breast cancer dataset and compare it to the classical SVM. Finally, we implement the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and many classical classifiers on the Iris dataset to compare their accuracies.},

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of tasks. The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}{\textbackslash}left(\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$\$ gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an \$\$n\$\$-qubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions - implicitly given by data samples - into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}{\textbackslash}left(poly{\textbackslash}left(n{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}right)\$\$ gates and can thus enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application.},

This is in contrast to the typical setting of quantum algorithms for optimization where a classical objective function is provided as a given Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem and mapped to a sum of Pauli operators. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification for our method based on convergence guarantees of quantum imaginary time evolution. To investigate the performance of our algorithm and its potential advantages, we tackle a challenging real-world optimization problem: feature selection. This refers to the problem of selecting a subset of relevant features to use for constructing a predictive model such as fraud detection. Optimal feature selection -- when formulated in terms of a generic loss function -- offers little structure on which to build classical heuristics, thus resulting primarily in 'greedy methods'. This leaves room for (near-term) quantum algorithms to be competitive to classical state-of-the-art approaches. We apply our quantum-optimization-based feature selection algorithm, termed VarQFS, to build a predictive model for a credit risk data set with 20 and 59 input features (qubits) and train the model using quantum hardware and tensor-network-based numerical simulations, respectively. We show that the quantum method produces competitive and in certain aspects even better performance compared to traditional feature selection techniques used in today's industry.},
